Applied network simplification

Proof of concept of network simplification using [sgeop](https://github.com/uscuni/sgeop) python package in a dockerized environment.

To be used as a development image in VS Code; the image is based on Ubuntu 24.04 and includes necessary packages for building and running the sgeop package.

## Contents:
- `/R` directory contains single file to create geopackage of a road network from OSM - it doesn't really matter which city you choose, but Plze≈à is as good a starting point as any :beers:. There is no hard technical need for the network to be simplified to originate from R, just (my) personal preference.
- `/python` directory contains a simple script to simplify the network; this is the action! The file should be executed from within the DevContainer in VS Code.
- `/data` directory contains the input and output files for the network simplification; these are gitignored for the sake of repo size, but can be generated using the /R and /python scripts.
- `visual-overview.qgz` is a QGIS project file to validate the results visually
